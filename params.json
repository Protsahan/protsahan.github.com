Encouragement","name":"Protsahan","body":"Protsahan India is a youth led organization that has traversed a path breaking journey \r\nsince 2010 as a registered non-profit organization, working under two broad heads of \r\nCREATIVE EDUCATION &  SKILL DEVELOPMENT. We work  at the  grassroot level in \r\nurban slums and on streets in India empowering marginalized children and women from \r\nlowest income backgrounds. It all started in 2010 when a 23 year old young girl quit her \r\ncorporate job and started creatively educating seven little girls from slums who were \r\nbeing  sexually/domestically  abused. Gradually  youngsters  across the  country  started \r\nsupporting her and Protsahan was born. Today, we have mobilized more than 12,000 \r\nyoung Indians living across borders for the cause that Protsahan stands for. We started \r\nwith one room creative arts school in Delhi. We have touched the lives of over a thousand \r\nchildren directly from  streets &  slums who were  subjected to  sexual  abuse  and drug \r\nabuse. We have also started programs for the marginalized slum women and artisans \r\nwhere we train them as design micro-entrepreneurs into making quality handicrafts, \r\nsanitary napkins etc. and are in the process of starting night schools for them. We believe \r\nin dignified earning and not blind charity.","google":"UA-37380512-1"}
