        <p>Protsahan India is a youth led organization that has traversed a path breaking journey 
since 2010 as a registered non-profit organization, working under two broad heads of 
CREATIVE EDUCATION &amp;  SKILL DEVELOPMENT. We work  at the  grassroot level in 
urban slums and on streets in India empowering marginalized children and women from 
lowest income backgrounds. It all started in 2010 when a 23 year old young girl quit her 
corporate job and started creatively educating seven little girls from slums who were 
being  sexually/domestically  abused. Gradually  youngsters  across the  country  started 
supporting her and Protsahan was born. Today, we have mobilized more than 12,000 
young Indians living across borders for the cause that Protsahan stands for. We started 
with one room creative arts school in Delhi. We have touched the lives of over a thousand 
children directly from  streets &amp;  slums who were  subjected to  sexual  abuse  and drug 
abuse. We have also started programs for the marginalized slum women and artisans 
where we train them as design micro-entrepreneurs into making quality handicrafts, 
sanitary napkins etc. and are in the process of starting night schools for them. We believe 
in dignified earning and not blind charity.</p>
