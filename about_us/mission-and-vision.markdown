The foundation works under two strategic heads:

* Creative Education
* Skills Development

**Our Vision** is of a world where every child will be educated well not on the basis of blind rote education,
but creatively, so that she/he finds true and uninhibited self expression; where every woman will
contribute to the happiness index of her household and community at large by being empowered herself,
economically and socially.
