### Who are we?

Protsahan India Foundation (hereafter ‘Protsahan’) is a secular, not for profit
organization registered under the Government of India as per The Indian Trusts Act of 1882. We got
registered on May 12, 2010.

‘Protsahan’ is a Hindi word which means ‘Encouragement’. Its a youth led organization which works
with street children and marginalized women in India.

Protsahan's Journey 

Protsahan started in 2010, when Founder-Director Ms. Sonal Kapoor was working on an assignment in one of the slums
in Delhi. She met a woman pregnant with her seventh child whom the mother was ready to
strangle if it was a girl again. The mother also sent her 8 year old to a brothel to feed the rest 5 daughters.
This shocked the Founder and fuelled her to organize acaption: classroom for the girl children in that particular
slum. 23 year old Sonal, quit her corporate job and started creatively educating seven little girls
from slums who were being sexually/domestically abused. This later led to what Protsahan is now.
A dynamic NGO which works towards providing creative education to at-risk street & slum children
and helping women earn a graceful livelihood; all this through extensive youth involvement and
volunteering. Gradually, youngsters across the country started supporting her and Protsahan was
born. Today Protsahan is working for hundreds of children and women and has mobilized more than
12,000 young Indian living across borders for the cause that it stands for. 
In 2012, youth led chapters across Mumbai, Chennai and Pune emerged to achieve Protsahan's mission. The movement has not stopped since. 
Residents in Singapore have also started to spread awareness about Protsahan's cause


### Mission and Vision

**Our Mission** is to encourage education and social development creatively through Art and
Technology. The foundation works under two strategic heads:

- Creative Education
- Skill Development

**Our Vision** is of a world where every child will be educated not just on the basis of blind rote
education, but creatively, so that she/he finds true and uninhibited self expression; where every
woman will contribute to the happiness index of her household and community at large by being
empowered herself in every way.

### What do we do?

We work at the grass root level in urban slums and on streets in India empowering
marginalized children and women from lowest income backgrounds. We aim to create creative
platforms of learning and self-expression. Empowerment is by the means of creative education and
skills training. We have also started programs for the marginalized slum women and artisans where
we train them as design micro-entrepreneurs into making handicrafts etc. and are in process for starting night schools for them.

### Where do we work?

We are based out of urban slums in west Delhi in Uttam Nagar and Vikaspuri at New Delhi.
We have weekend slum programs across Mumbai, Pune and Chennai. In Singapore we have people supporting operations in India.

### What difference have we made since 2010?

We have touched lives of over a thousand children
directly from streets and slums, who were subject to sexual and drug abuse. Currently we have
about 350 children under Project Educare, whom we teach on a daily basis. We have worked with
scores of women under Project Stree and taught them how to make home decor products. We have carried out health and nutrition based workshops for the mother & street child
under Project Stree.
