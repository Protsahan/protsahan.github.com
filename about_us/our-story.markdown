**Protsahan**’s journey started in 2010, by chance, when Sonal, a young 24 year old was working on a
corporate film assignment in one of the slums in Delhi. That’s where she met a woman pregnant with
her seventh child whom she was ready to strangle if it was a girl again. This woman also sent her 8
year old girl to a brothel to feed the rest of her 5 daughters. This shocked the young 24 year old and
fuelled her to quit her cushy job and organize a small creative arts classroom for the sexually abused
girl children in that slum. What had started as a mere 1 room classroom in the darkest ghettoes of
Uttam Nagar slums in Delhi, became a case study that started becoming international in its appeal
and simplicity of model. The innovative use of Colour, Technology, Design and Art Based Therapies in
the darkest corners of the country left people spellbound. This later led to what Protsahan is now. A
dynamic and one of the most innovative organizations across the world which works towards providing
creative education to at-risk street & slum children and helping women earn a graceful livelihood; all
this through extensive youth involvement. Gradually, youngsters across the country started supporting
her through never heard before innovative fundraising campaigns and Protsahan became huge. Today
Protsahan is working for hundreds of children and women at the grassroot and has mobilized more
than 28,000 young Indian living across borders for the cause that it stands for.
